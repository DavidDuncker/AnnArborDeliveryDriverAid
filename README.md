APK download link: https://github.com/DavidDuncker/AnnArborDeliveryDriverAid/raw/master/ZoomerAid.apk
Works only on Android phones, version 4.1 and above.
The database only contains addresses that aren't pinpointed by Google Maps. 
In the app, when no text is entered into the search bar, and the "Search" button is pressed, the entire database will be listed.

/app/src/main/java contains the java files;  /app/src/main/res/layout contains the XML layout files.
